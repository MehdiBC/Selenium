# Selenium
Selenium is a free and open-source test automation suite used for automating web-based applications. 
It supports automation across different browsers, platforms, and programming languages.

Selenium is not just a single tool but a suite of software's, It has four components:
  - Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environement)
  - Selenium RC (Remote Control)
  - Selenium WebDriver
  - Selenium Grid
  
  
## Selenium IDE:
Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the simplest framework in the Selenium suite and is the easiest one to learn.

                      Pros                                |                               Cons
    
    + Very easy to use and install                        |           - Designed only for prototypes of tests
    + No programming knowledge is required though         |           - No support for iterations and conditional operations
    knowledge of HTML and DOM is needed                   |           - Test execution is slow compared to WebDriver and Selenium RC
    + Can export tests to formats to be used by           |
    WebDriver and Selenium RC                             |
    + Generates reports of tests results                  |
    + Provides support for extensions                     |
    
    
    
## Selenium WebDriver
WebDriver is a web automation framework.
It allows you to execute your tests against different browsers using a programming language. You can now perform iterations and conditional operations.

  -> It controls the browser from the OS level
  -> You can use different programming languages
  -> Testing web applications across different browsers

## Selenium RC
Selenium RC is a test automation tool supporting different programming languages.
It comprises of two parts: 
  + Client libraries for the prefered computer language
  + Server that launches and kills browsers automatically
  
## WebDriver VS Selenium RC
  -> WebDriver is faster than Selenium RC because it has a simpler achitecture ( WebDriver interacts with the Browser through the operating system )
  ->
